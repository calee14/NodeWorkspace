# Contributing
If you're using the SDK and you find a missing feature or a bug, 
please contribute your fixes back to us!

## How to get started

### Fork the repository, clone it and get it ready for development:
```
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/gettyimages-api_nodejs.git
cd gettyimages-api_nodejs
npm install
```

### Run the tests!
Before you change anything, run the tests. They *should* all pass
as we don't commit to master with failing tests, but hey, you never
know!

```sh
npm run unittest
```
This will also show you where we're at with code coverage.

The tests are written with [Ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava). 

Ideally, if you add completely new functionality, you would write your tests first.

### Increase the Chances of Your Pull Request Being Accepted

Before [submitting a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
, here's a few tips:
+ Follow our coding style. The linter is your friend here.
+ Write tests. If you've added new behavior, we'll need a scenario
to cover it.
+ Run the tests! If the tests are all passing, you'll save yourself
the step of fixing them after you've submitted the pull requests
and the automated build fails.
+ Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)


```sh
npm run unittest
npm run lint
```

If the tests pass and the linter returns no errors, your pull request 
will be ***much*** more likely to be accepted.
