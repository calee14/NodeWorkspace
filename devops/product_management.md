# Prod. Management w/ Jason @UCSB DS Founder
## History on Product Management
- throughline npr
	- follows the origins of american behaviors and how we got there
		- e.g. tipping culture, eating sugar
- procter and gamble
	- the CEO hired brand managers -> eventually become product manager role
		- neil mcelroy CEO 1930s created the brandman
		- **brandman** - represent an product component end-to-end: price, design, utility
	- worked closely with sales and marketing
- as a product manager advocates for user (customer) needs and wants
	- e.g. there is a product group for each individual component of the facebook app
		- sign on, photos, posts
- post-WWII Japan, economy in ruins an no liquidity
	- led to the **lean manufacturing** rather than **whole sale**
		- whole sale make a bunch of products and keep inventory
	- **lean manufacturing** - a.k.a. just-in-time manufacturing
- product managers in software managers focus on the product and user end experience
## Product Management in practice
- there is usually some friction between the product manager and the developer
- product manager does whatever is required for the success of the product
	- decides what gets built
	- defines the user interface
	- defines the metrics of success for the product
- how to PMs decide what gets built
	- interview the customer
		- ask 'how do you do x currently'
		- 'show me how you currently do x'
	- user studies
		- here's the product, now do x
			- see how the user uses the app **correctly or incorrectly**
	- product studies
		- see how the user funnel's through the app
		- visit web page, view service, use service, click payment, pay
		- see what features user's like
	- market
		- business data, competitive analysis, gartner & forrester reports
		- hacker news, reddit
- user interface
	- functional specification
		- user and use cases
	- as a x (student), i want to y (make a schedule) so that I have z (multiple schedules incase of conflicts)
- success metrics
	- how do you decide a success with the product
		- user pays or gets their desire
- gotta sit there to see how the users are messing up in using the product
- do easy shit first (tech says get the low hanging fruit)
	- economics: cost * benefit
		- the low cost tasks will usually bring the most benefit
