# NGINX: webserver overview
- **nginx** is a webserver proxy that forwards incoming HTTP requests to applications/other servers (gunicorn)
	- nginx is a webserver that efficiently processes HTTP requests
		- it load balances requests and caches them too
		- useful for media streaming, and email servers too
		- good for distributing load traffic
- **gunicorn** is also a server, but it handles http requests for Python applications
	- nginx doesn't understand python so gunicorn takes the requests proxied by nginx and processes them for the python applications
	- gunicorn them forwards the HTTP requests to the python processes
	- a python process can be a Flask or Django application running
- **Flask/Django** are web frameworks that describe how a web page/app works.
	- it handles what/how data is processed by the application
	- it will take the requests processed by gunicorn
	- there might be multiple flask/django app processes running
		- this helps isolate each request for **concurrency**
- The **flow**:
	- client makes https request
	- nginx accepts request, load balances across all applications/servers running app. proxies the request to them
	- gunicorn a web server that can turn http requests into something understandable by python. runs the python apps into computer processes and fowards the http request
	- Flask/Django are web frameworks that describe how the webpage works. will handle incoming http requests and what to do with them for the application
