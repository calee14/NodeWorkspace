# Defining Services
- Building **requirements** for a project ask the questiosn:
    - who? - user, developers and stakeholders of app (who is being affected)
    - what? - main areas of functionality of app but it has to be clear. 
    - why? - reason for needing the system.
    - when? - timeline for users and developers
    - how? - how will the system work? number of users at a time? amount of data?
        - average payload size of service requests? latency requirements?
        - where users are
- Roles represent the goal of a user. 
    - However, it can also be a microservice talking to another service
    - brainstorm roles of what users might do and then group together ones that belong to a specific action = role
    - **Persona** - a typical person who takes a role.
        - tells a story about that person and what they do
    - **User stories** - describe what the user wants the app to do and why the want to do it
        - **INVEST** criteria. evaluate user stories
            - Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimatable, Small, Testable
- **Quantitative requirements** - measureable data based on constraints: time, finance, people
    - availability (accessibility), latency (time), throughput (durability, how much we can handle)
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** - measure success of product, app
    - for business: ROI, EBIT, Employee turnover, Customer churn
    - for tech: Page view, User registration, Clickthroughs, Checkouts
    - KPI's indicate if you're on track to acheive the goal
    - Need to define KPIs that mean success and signs that we're reaching the goal
    - KPIs must be **SMART**
        - Specific (more detail better), Measurable (know steps to reach objective), Achievable (attainable), Relevant (make sure it matters and is benefitial), Time-based (due dates, time available)
- **Service Level Indicators** - measurement of features of a service
    - Error rate, throughput, latency
    - must be countable/measureable and bound by time
        - Good to use percentile metrics for SLIs
- **Service Level Objectives** - agreed target of values for a measurement from an SLI
    - 
- **Service Level Agreements** - agreement between service provider and consumer
    - service provider defines responsibilities and consequences if service not met
