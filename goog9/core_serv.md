# Idenity and Access Management
- Heirarchy - Organization, Folders (Departments), Projects, Resources
    - Rules for the Organization is inherited down, same for the other levels
- **Organiztaion Role**: 
    - **Super Admin.** - Assign Org. Roles to users
    - **Org. Admin** - Control all cloud resources
        - Creator, Viewer, Admin types
    - **Project creator** - Below Org. Admin (inherited) - controls who can access/create projects
        - There is a creator and deleter specification
    - Can work in **folders** which are considered sub organizations withing the **Cloud Organization**
        - Org. Role might have access to only one folder
- Services have their own roles (Compute Engine):
    - **Compute Engine**, **Network**, **Storage**
- Make custom roles with GCP but they will not be automatically updated when services and resources are updated
- IAM cannot make users and groups but can only apply rules to them.
    - Use Cloud Identity or Workspace to make groups and users
- **IAM Policies** - contains many **bindings** of which they are connected to a bunch of acccounts, groups, services, and domains. 
- **Role** a list of permissions defined by IAM
    - The less restrictive role overrides the more restrictive role
        - So best to follow least-privilege
