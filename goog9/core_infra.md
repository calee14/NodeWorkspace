# Introducing Google Cloud
- Cloud-computing customers go through **automated interface** (no human)
    - scale usage and pay as go <- better bc no need to invest so much into infra
- Rent virtual computing, still maintain lots of control
- Infrastructure aaS - compute power, storage, network
- Platform aaS - libraries to connect to IaaS and build applications (APIs)
- **NOTE:** zones good for performance
- **NOTE:** pay-by-sec good for users with lots of VMs
- Deploy in diff zones prevent loss of application
- GC has security in the hardware (chips) and software (2FA, boot stack)
- Google Networks handle 40% of the internet 100 PoPs
    - 5ms latency for zones in network
- Kubernetes can set quotas on requests to API
# Getting started with Google Cloud
- **IAM = Identity and Access Management**
- Create organization roles, project manager roles
    - Policies created are inherited by children
- Services + resources per project basis
- Put projects in folders to share policies
- IAM - Instance Admin Role in Projects
- Control Google Cloud Platform; web interface; console, SDK, API
- Cloud marketplace: easily start up web apps, VMs
- **Appache HTTP server** - open-source server software that delivers data accross the internet.
    - Runs the server, helps the server accept HTTP requests and receive and send data
    - Competitors are **NGINX** (Flask is best run on this type of server software)
        - NGINX also is known as a **reverse proxy** web server 
        - web broswer (outside info) -> NGINX (reverse) -> webserver
# Virtual Machines in the CLoud
- Virtual Private Cloud Networks - contained in Projects
    - VMs IP. address will be in the VPC network.
        - New subnets will allocate new address to current IP
        - VPC subsets have regional scope
- **Compute Engine** helps create VM
    - configure CPU, memory, SSD, disks
- **Preemptible VMs** - cheap but will restart if CPU is needed elsewhere
- Cloud Load Balancing - one single IP address for project
    - sent to google backbone and route to nearest PoP
- DNS translates domain names to IP address
- Google CP interconnect help with business current networks connect to GCP routes/apps
