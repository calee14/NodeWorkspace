# V8 Engine (taught by ChatGPT)
- node.js is a cross-platform runtime: can run on any OS (Windows, macOS, Linux)
	- how does it run on any OS?
		- node.js is written in C++ thus it doesn't need a runtime or virtualization
	- node.js is good for microservices that communicate with each other
	- it is built on top of the V8 engine
		- the V8 engine executes JS code 
- V8 engine is software that is written in C++ 
	- it executes javiascript code quickly and efficiently
	- uses just-in-time compilation = on the fly
		- converts javascript code into native machine code on the go rather than ahead of time
	- just-in-time allows for optimization for the specific OS and hardware
	- good for javscript code that needs to scale
